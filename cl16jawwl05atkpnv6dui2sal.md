Hello everyone,

Did you make a lot of GitHub commits lately? 😃

​
Today, I want to share with you some new features, I'd even date to call them "hacks", that you try out.

I'm sure you're familiar with GitHub, but there are a few features that you might have missed. Let's explore them together.

### 👉 VSCode in Browser
Browsing repositories isn't convenient with a standard GitHub interface. How about opening that repo in VSCode without cloning or downloading anything? 😺

That'll offer effortless navigation.

How to do that?

There are typically three ways, but the last one has my preference. 👇

🔷 Replace the [github.com](https://github.com) URL with [Github.dev​](https://github.dev)

🔷 Change github.com to github1s.com URL

🔷 Simply press . (dot) key on your keyboard

Incredible, isn't it? 😍

### 👉 URL Shortener
Don't want to share a relatively long URL?

Well, that's where the GitHub featured URL shortener comes in. Git.io is your answer.

### 👉 Shortcuts
GitHub provides a good number of shortcuts to help manageable access.

The good news is you don't necessarily have to remember them. 😄

Press the ? on your keyboard to see the particular listing of shortcuts for that specific page.

​

### 👉 Skyline
Made with love, Skyline is a free 3D model view of your GitHub contribution graph. You can share it or even print it for yourself.

Head over to skyline.github.com to glimpse your glorious graph right away.

​

### 👉 Colors
Documentation is a good habit; making it look elegant is even better. You may need to specify some color codes in your markdown file, which can be combined with this hack of GitHub to render a visual appearance of color code.

Place the hex color code in backticks— #ff00ff to render a tile in that color. Hexcellent, isn't it?

​

That's it for today. Don't forget to try these features out.
